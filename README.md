## About me: 
I am a fullstack software engineer.  At present, I am adding new features to one of my recent full stack projects -  a beer review site that focuses on optimally aging beers that age well.  The site currently uses React and ES6 for a seamless single-page experience, and has schema that allows for maximized flexibility in querying to support my upcoming features as the app develops.  I am currently developing features for users to search by highest rated, highest rated per year aged, and statistics on a specific beer's reviews as it ages. 

On a personal note, I am a home brewer, a ceramic artist (specialties include alternative firing techniques, and Kintsugi - the Japanese art of repairing ceramics with gold).  I bake, collect mineral specimens and meteorites, and am always looking for opportunities to expand my horizons- whether it is traveling to new cultures, learning new crafts or specialties (did I mention I am a PADI certified Shark Conservation Specialist?), or pushing my own boundaries with activities like sky diving or SCUBA. Oh yeah, and 99% of the photos on my phone are of my dog doing silly things.  If you ask to see some, I will send a ridiculous number.
